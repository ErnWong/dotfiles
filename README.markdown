Previous versions:
- Until 2024: NixOS with divnix/digga: https://github.com/ErnWong/dotfiles-old-divnix
- Untill 2020: Manual shell scripts: https://github.com/ErnWong/dotfiles-old-linux

Why another repo? Because the previous one was generated from a divnix/digga template which is no longer maintained, and I wanted to try simplify my configuration as it turned out I didn't really need the extra layers of abstraction at the moment.
